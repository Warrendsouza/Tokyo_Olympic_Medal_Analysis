# Tokyo_Olympic_Medal_Analysis




Overview
This project analyzes the Olympic Medals dataset (1896-2016) using Azure cloud services to extract insights and create visualizations. It demonstrates the use of various data engineering and analysis techniques to process and derive meaningful information from a large historical dataset.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Olympic Medals dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. It contains information on all Olympic medalists from the modern Olympic Games, from 1896 to 2016. Key columns include:

Athlete details (ID, Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight)
Team and National Olympic Committee
Olympic Games information (Year, Season, City)
Sport and Event details
Medal type
